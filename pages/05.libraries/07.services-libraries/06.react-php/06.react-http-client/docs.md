## Basic usage

Requests are prepared using the ``Client#request()`` method.

The `Request#write(string $data)` method can be used to
write data to the request body.
Data will be buffered until the underlying connection is established, at which
point buffered data will be sent and all further data will be passed to the
underlying connection immediately.

The `Request#end(?string $data = null)` method can be used to
finish sending the request.
You may optionally pass a last request body data chunk that will be sent just
like a `write()` call.
Calling this method finalizes the outgoing request body (which may be empty).
Data will be buffered until the underlying connection is established, at which
point buffered data will be sent and all further data will be ignored.

The `Request#close()` method can be used to
forefully close sending the request.
Unlike the `end()` method, this method discards any buffers and closes the
underlying connection if it is already established or cancels the pending
connection attempt otherwise.

Request implements WritableStreamInterface, so a Stream can be piped to it.
Interesting events emitted by Request:

* `response`: The response headers were received from the server and successfully
  parsed. The first argument is a Response instance.
* `drain`: The outgoing buffer drained and the response is ready to accept more
  data for the next `write()` call.
* `error`: An error occurred, an `Exception` is passed as first argument.
* `close`: The request is closed. If an error occurred, this event will be
  preceeded by an `error` event.

Response implements ReadableStreamInterface.
Interesting events emitted by Response:

* `data`: Passes a chunk of the response body as first argument.
  When a response encounters a chunked encoded response it will parse it
  transparently for the user and removing the `Transfer-Encoding` header.
* `error`: An error occurred, an `Exception` is passed as first argument.
* `end`: The response has been fully received.
* `close`: The response is closed. If an error occured, this event will be
  preceeded by an `error` event.

### Example

```php
<?php

$loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$client = new React\HttpClient\Client($loop);

$request = $client->request('GET', 'https://github.com/');
$request->on('response', function ($response) {
    $response->on('data', function ($data, $response) {
        // ...
    });
});
$request->end();
$loop->run();
```
